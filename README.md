Visualizing and Comparing Multiple OpenAI Gym Experiments

## Ever wanted to visualize and compare multiple experimental runs from OpenAI?
Me too.

## How do I use this?
1. Start with the notebook, see if it fits your needs.
2. Copy over some experimenal results worth comparing, there are currently a few example folders here so that you can get a sense of the structure and funcionality.
3. Revel in the beautiful aggregate statistics.

## But korymath, it's not working! 
First, this was a proof of concept hackup. 
Second, drop an issue and let's figure out how to make this work more robustly together.

## What's next?
There are lots more statistics to capture from OpenAI gym, and this just shows a single sample...

## Thanks
