Visualizing and Comparing Multiple OpenAI Gym Experiments

## Ever wanted to visualize and compare multiple experimental runs from OpenAI?
Me too.

## How do I use this?
1. Try out the notebook, see if it fits your needs.
2. Copy over some experimenal results worth comparing.
3. Comment out the CRITICAL bit where I add random noise because I wanted to use a single test set, but still wanted some simulated difference.
4. Revel in the beautiful aggregate statistics figure.

## What's next?
There are lots more statistics to capture from OpenAI gym, and this just shows a single sample...
